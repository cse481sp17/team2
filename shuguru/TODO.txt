1. Pass map file of our choice to navigation node launched via launch file.
2. Document everything that needs to be launched when running our application (navigation, marker detection, etc) 
3. Pass map of class to navigation and use our command line tool to set markers for the shelf and 1 or 2 station
4. Pass map of class to navigation and run our state machine program - if robot successfully goes from shelf to station and back, that means AR detection works

Qs:
Does the state machine create a new instance of the state object each time it reaches it, or does it only use one instance throughout?
